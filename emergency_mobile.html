Our office at 101 Montgomery Street falls within the affected area. PG&E is working actively to address the outage, but projects that power will remain out until late afternoon.
                           <br>As a result, all employees at that location are advised to work from home today. Follow-on notifications will be sent out with an update later today, as we receive updates from PG&E."</p>
