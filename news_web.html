                            <br class="web-space">The meeting, held shortly after the presidential election, raises new questions about Mr. Trump’s willingness to use the power of the presidency to advance his business interests. Mr. Trump has long opposed a wind farm planned near his course in <span class="bold">Aberdeenshire</span>, and he previously fought unsuccessfully all the way to Britain’s highest court to block it.

                            The group that met with Mr. Trump in New York was led by Mr. Farage, the head of the U.K. Independence Party and a member of the European Parliament. Mr. Farage, who was <span class="bold">a leading voice advocating Britain’s exit from the European Union</span>, or Brexit, campaigned with Mr. Trump during the election. Arron Banks, an insurance executive who was a major financier of the Brexit campaign, was also in attendance.

                            “He did not say <span class="bold">he hated wind farms as a concept</span>; he just did not like them spoiling the views,” said Andy Wigmore, the media consultant who was present at the meeting and was photographed with Mr. Trump.
